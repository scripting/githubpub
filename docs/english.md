## Using the English editor

It's a simple editor that hooks into GitHubPub. Based on the medium-editor component. Its purpose is to provide a testbed for API functions and an example of how a GHP editor works. Even so, it aspires to be a useful and usable tool.

### It's wizzy but it produces Markdown code

You can use it as if you were using Medium, but when it saves text to the server it saves it as Markdown. However it is remarkably flexible. You can directly enter Markdown codes in the text and they will be correctly interpreted. 

### You can also directly enter HTML code

You can also enter raw HTML code, and it should also work.

### Insert HTML command

The Insert HTML command is there if you have a complex bit of HTML on the clipboard that the editor is having trouble with. 

I use it for pasting in embed code for YouTube videos. It could be useful for other types of complex HTML.
