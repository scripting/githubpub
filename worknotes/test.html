				<li>we still have "blog/" in the setup for englishHome</li>

				<ul>

					<li>the factoring job started there is not done</li>

					<ul>

						I understand why. When we punted on changing the way EH works to use domains instead of username/repo/path, it made it impossible to hide the relative path of the things it's editing. That was never configured on the server. domain.path is irrelevant, as it's currently implemented.

						

						interfaces that take domain in place of username/repo/path

						

						/get

						/save

						/getpost

						/savepost

						</ul>

					okay we have the code in testPasteHTML () in englishHome.

					I have an idea for this

					You have to have your own repo for it to work

					</ul>

				<li>Okay good work session, next up...</li>

				<ul>

					Use the same CSS file for both the editor and the rendering

					That pretty much guarantees WYSIWYG. ;-)

					</ul>

				<li>big idea -- convert englishserver to use xml-rpc interface</li>

				<ul>

					or add an xml-rpc interface and use it fron englishhome

					</ul>

				<li>here's how the REST calls for GitHub server work now</li>

				<ul>

					get/save -- work with absolute paths

					getblogdata/saveblogdata -- use the path

				<li>nodeEditorSuite.gitHub.upload has a problem</li>

				<ul>

					we call the save function on english server

					we changed what it returns. ooops, this code depends on the original functionality.

					I didn't see that coming ;-)

					</ul>

				<li>UI work continues</li>

				<ul>

					On a new post the Description placeholder is empty

					<li>What about auto-save</li>

					<ul>

						Clearly if present should be a preference

						Default on?

						</ul>

					CSS needs updating. H4 is wrong font/shape.

					<li>The H2 and H4 items in the popup are broken.</li>

					<ul>

						Probably has to do with the version of medium-editor we're using

						</ul>

					<li>Change the look of the editor to be more like the pages</li>

					<ul>

						I don't like the huge text. 

						</ul>

					<li>Done</li>

					<ul>

						get rid of the file list on the left

						steal the look from myword.io

						add description element for the sub-text

						</ul>

					</ul>

				<li>Upheaval --</li>

				<ul>

					<li>the paths we use should have the "blog/" prefix removed.</li>

					<ul>

						there's no need for the editor to have this, because it's not part of the url

						it should be hidden by the server, it's part of the configuration, it should be easily changed.

						</ul>

					<li>notes</li>

					<ul>

						<li>appConsts.blogDataPath and appConsts.blogPostsPath should change to </li>

				<li>Let's work on UI</li>

				<ul>

					Leave the server alone for a while. Whew. Too much rock and roll.

					Try getting the file list into a dialog, let's see what it looks like with more horizonal room.

					</ul>

				<li>Cleanup</li>

				<ul>

					Move englishblog1.scripting.com to point to rockaway.scripting.com. Tell pagepark to route it to english server (port 1402).

					<li>There are two routines to get the contents of a file from GitHub, one in githubpub and the other in englishserver</li>

				<li>Things to look at next after integration of english server and githubpub</li>

				<ul>

				<li>todo</li>

				<ul>

					<li>eye icon takes you to the rendering</li>

					<ul>

						the englishHome server has to know the URL of the site its saving to?

						or the githubpub functionality has to be integrated into englishHome?

						thinking needed...

						</ul>

					good fallback when there is no template in the repository.
